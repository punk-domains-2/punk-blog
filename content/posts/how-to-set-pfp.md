Let's assume you already have your own punk domain. If you still havenâ€™t got one, [here is a step-by-step guide](/posts/how-to-buy-first-domain) to get yours. Seriously, you should get one. ðŸ˜Ž

Having your own digital identity in web3 is a powerful tool. There are so many things that you can do with it. In this guide we'll tell you how to set a profile picture for your punk domain. 

For every domain that you own, you can set **arbitrary custom data**. You can add your homepage URL, you can store your Twitter handle, or you can set a profile picture.

Here is a step-by-step process. 

### 1. Go to the Punk Domains website

Link: https://punk.domains

Or a similar browser wallet like Rabby or Tally.

### 5. Enter custom data

This is where you can add one or multiple information to your Punk Domain. In this case we will add a simple image URL from the internet. 

The image URL should start with `http` and end with one of the image or gif extensions, such as `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.gif`.

If you have a correct image URL, just copy-paste it into the `imgAddress` field.

### 6. Submit custom data to blockchain

To complete this process, click on Edit Data button. This will open your Metamask. Confirm the transaction. 

> *Tip: Make sure you have enough funds to cover the fees.*

### 7. The new image should load

Your new image should now be visible in the Punk Domain Data site. In our case a familiar gentleman. ðŸ•º

### 8. You can also see it in sidebar

You can now also see your new profile image in the sidebar (but only if this domain is set as your default domain).

> *Note that setting a custom image will not replace or remove your default domain image. The default image will always stay the same (and youâ€™ll be able to see it on NFT marketplaces).* 
> 
> *Setting a profile image in custom data just gives an option to frontends (such as web3 social websites or games) to show this image instead of the default domain image.*

Adding a profile picture for your punk domain is just one of the features you can use.

There are many more things you can try out. Weâ€™ll explore more features in our future blog posts. Stay tuned!
