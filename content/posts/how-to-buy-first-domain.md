You have just found the second most amazing thing on the internet - besides cute cat videos, that is. 😸

Meet Punk Domains, a magical place where you can create your own digital identity for the Web3. Fully decentralized and permissionless on the blockchain. The way it should be.

To get your first Punk Domain you need:

1. Metamask (or a similar web3 wallet: Rabby, Tally, etc.)
2. Idea for a name (this is a tough one, I know 😅)  
3. Choose your network (Optimism, BNB, Gnosis, Polygon, Arbitrum)
4. Choose your favorite TLD (.poly, .ape, .op, .wagmi, .optimism, .safu,..)
5. That is all 🤘😎

Now that you have everything needed, let's get you your first domain. Here is a step-by-step process. 

### 1. Go to the Punk Domains website

Here's the URL: https://punk.domains/

### 2. Connect your Metamask (or other) wallet

If you use a MetaMask alternative such as Rabby, click on the MetaMask button anyway.

*Tip: Make sure you have enough funds to cover the price + gas for minting the domain.*
