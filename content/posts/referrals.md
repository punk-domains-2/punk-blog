Punk Domains is a protocol that offers domains for DAOs and other communities. 

We launched 20+ top-level domains across different chains so far. More than 10k domains have been minted through our protocol until now. 

We are now inviting anybody to participate in our referral program and earn a 10% reward for every referred domain mint.

## Here is how it works

The referral reward system is **integrated** into our smart contracts. 

Any domain payment through a referral link **automatically** takes the reward and transfers it to the referrer. 

The reward is paid out **instantly** in the token that the domain was minted in ($ETH, $USDC, $MATIC, $BNB, or $SGB). There is no max cap on rewards.

> *Rewards are listed in USD only for better reference. Rewards are paid in the same token that the domain was bought in. Rewards in USD fluctuates based on the current market token price.*

## Where to find your referral link?

The referral link is a unique URL that leads to the Punk Domains mint website. The referral URL includes your wallet address or your domain where the reward will be paid out to.

You can find it on the bottom of the [Profile page](https://punk.domains/#/profile):

There are **two types** of referral links:

- Referral link with wallet address
- Referral link with domain name

Here is an example of the referral link with the **wallet address**: 

```bash
https://punk.domains/#/?ref=0x5FfD23B1B0350debB17A2cB668929aC5f76d0E18
```

Here is an example of the referral link with your **punk domain**: 

```bash
https://punk.domains/#/?ref=tekr.degen
```

Both referral links have the same function and both work fine. We suggest using the referral link with your punk domain name because it looks better. ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜Ž

## How to get referral rewards for our partner domains

Some punk domains are owned and operated by our partners and the minting app is hosted on their website. 

Here is a list of some of our partners websites or special pages:

- Layer2DAO: https://punk.domains/#/partners/l2dao
- Songbird Domains: https://songbird.domains/#/ 
- People Domains: https://ppl.domains/#/ 
- KlimaDAO: http://www.kns.earth/#/
- The Wild Bunch Domains: https://twb.punk.domains/#/ 

If you intend to promote our partners domains, make sure to use the correct URL as the referral link. 

Here is an example of the referral link for Songbird Domains: 

```html
https://songbird.domains/?ref=tekr.sgb
```

If you are not sure your referral link is correct you can always reach out to us over [Discord](https://discord.gg/8dSrwrAQeu ) and our team will be happy to assist you.
