Together with the Songbird community we have [launched a new domain extension](https://songbird.domains), `.sgb`. In the first couple of days after the launch (in mid October 2022) more than 500 domain names were registered.

### What is Songbird

Songbird Network is the canary network for the Flare blockchain. Flare Network is an EVM-compatible blockchain with some very interesting additional features, such as the [state connector](https://docs.flare.network/tech/state-connector/#) and a native [oracle layer (FTSO)](https://docs.flare.network/tech/ftso/). 

With these unique features, Flare aims to connect various networks, both EVM and non-EVM chains.

Songbird is the name of the Flare‚Äôs canary network. It is an operational blockchain with a limited token supply that is intended to be used to test features for the upcoming mainnet (Flare).

### Songbird Domains = Web3 Domains

Web3 domains are a **digital identity** in the web3 (social) world. 

People can use domains as usernames when they log into a web3 app. They can attach additional data to a domain, like a website URL or a Twitter handle. Or they can use domains to [easily send tokens](https://songbird.domains/#/send-tokens) and NFTs to each other.

You can find all registered Songbird domains as NFTs on the SparklesNFT marketplace: https://sparklesnft.com/collection/songbirddomains/
