We are thrilled to announce the collaboration between Punk Domains and the Flare foundation. Some time ago, we introduced domain extensions  `.sgb` ([Songbird Domains](https://songbird.domains/)) and `.flr` ([flr.domains](https://flr.domains/)), and the response has been overwhelming, with thousands of registrations pouring in.

These domain extensions serve as [easily readable labels for blockchain addresses](/posts/traditional-vs-web3-domains/). They offer a convenient way to represent personal usernames, profiles, and identities in the rapidly expanding web3 world. 

Users can utilize domain names as their web3 social media handles, attach data to them, and simplify the process of sending tokens by employing a domain instead of a lengthy string of numbers and letters.

### Web3 Social on Songbird

In addition to the `.sgb` and `.flr` domains, we are proud to have launched the first-ever open-source decentralized social network on Songbird, SGB Chat. 

SGB Chat has been meticulously crafted to overcome the limitations of traditional web2 social networks, such as censorship and de-monetization. It boasts a content minting feature, allowing creators to monetize their contributions.

To ensure data integrity and long-term preservation, the content is stored on decentralized storage systems. 

Furthermore, SGB Chat seamlessly integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, enabling users to access token swaps and other DeFi features without ever leaving the platform.

### Whatâ€™s Next?

Our future plans involve integrating the `.sgb` and `.flr` domains into the [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/), significantly simplifying crypto transfers for Flare and Songbird users. 

To ensure consistent pricing for the domains, regardless of fluctuations in SGB and FLR prices, we will integrate the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO). Additionally, we are actively developing a Flare version of SGB Chat.

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for the warm welcome and excitement shown by the Flare and Songbird community. Inspired by this support, we eagerly look forward to continuing our work on the Flare and Songbird platforms.
