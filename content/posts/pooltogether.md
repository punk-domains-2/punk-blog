If you're looking for a way to **save money** and **have fun** at the same time, [PoolTogether](https://pooltogether.com/) is the answer! It's a protocol that allows you to save your crypto and to play a game. 

The game gives you a ticket that can make you win more money every week, and even if you don’t win, **you don’t lose your money** or tickets.

### Under the hood

Let's see on an example how the PoolTogether protocol works under the hood.

For example, you can buy a ticket for 1 USDC. This USDC is then **combined together** with other USDCs that people used to buy tickets, and then sent to Aave, where it **earns interest**. 
 
Every week, the interest is collected and **used as rewards** in PoolTogether. Anyone who holds a ticket **has a chance to win** one of the rewards.

If you get tired of the game and decide not to participate anymore, you can sell your ticket back to the protocol and receive back **the same amount of USDC** that you intially paid for the ticket.

Let's dive deeper into the world of PoolTogether and PoolTogether Names (`.pool`) and find out what it's all about.

### The Founding Story of PoolTogether

PoolTogether was founded by [Leighton Cusack](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs) and **Brendan Asselstine** in 2019. The idea behind PoolTogether was to create a savings game that would incentivize people to save money. 

The game is based on Premium Bonds, which are a type of savings bond issued by the UK government. Since its inception, PoolTogether has become one of the most innovative and exciting projects in the blockchain space.

### PoolTogether: More Than Just a Game

PoolTogether is a **protocol** governed by a **decentralized autonomous organization** (DAO). This means that it's controlled by the community of POOL token holders, who can vote on how to improve and manage the protocol. 

PoolTogether Inc. is a company that created and launched the PoolTogether protocol, but it **does not** control or own it. The company still supports and contributes to PoolTogether but as one of many participants in the DAO.

### Achievements to be Proud Of

PoolTogether has achieved a lot in a short amount of time. But what makes the team behind it most proud is the **amazing community** they've built. 

The community is made up of **people from all over the world** who come together to help each other and contribute to the protocol and DAO.

### The Future of PoolTogether

In the next five years, PoolTogether aims to become **the go-to platform for incentivizing people to save money**. 

It plans to achieve this by building a new **hyperstructure** that will combine all yield into a single token by continuously liquidating yield for the prize token. 

This affords these major advantages:

- Supports larger prizes
- The design supports any number of assets and yield sources
- Prizes are adjusted automatically to ensure there are both large and plentiful prizes
- The protocol runs autonomously without any kind of governance
- New assets and yield sources can be added permission-lessly

### Partnership with Punk Domains

PoolTogether has partnered with Punk Domains to create a [PoolTogether Names](https://names.pooly.me/) (`.pool`) for its community. The decision to partner with Punk Domains was made after a community vote. 

PoolTogether Names are not only a **short version of user's wallet address**, but also function as a **web3 username** in the upcoming Web3 Social. 

With `.pool` domains being hosted on the **Optimism** network and functioning as **NFTs**, they offer the benefits of blockchain technology like security, immutability, and decentralized ownership.

In addition, `.pool` domain owners can attach other information to their domain such as a website, social media handles, and profile picture, making it an all-encompassing online identity.

> _You can set up your own website on .pool domain using [Pool Limo](https://pool.limo/), an excellent tool developed by the PoolTogether community member [@trmid](https://twitter.com/trmidpoint)._

Moreover, the Punk Domains protocol is **open source**, allowing other decentralized applications to integrate `.pool` names into their own app, thus expanding the reach of this unique feature. 

By owning a `.pool` domain, users can showcase their **connection to the PoolTogether community**, while also benefiting from the added functionality and security of owning a blockchain-based NFT.
